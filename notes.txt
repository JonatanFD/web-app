1. We are redifining the project entity to clean it up
Now the layers are not grouped by the "canvas" object anymore, its the project itself.
2. Policies
when a project is sold or published as a blueprint, then the project is blocked from being modified.

3. a transaction only represents the payment transaction
applied_discounts, commission.

4. an order could have a null transaction_id if it is not paid yet. this means
that the manufacturer does not know about this order yet. only when the order is paid, the transaction_id is set.
and the manufacturer is notified about the order.

5. db json shows only the response from the server.
